Found in one of the largest passenger ships on the planet, the MS Oasis of the Seas, the Rising Tide Elevator Bar is one of the only elevators that doubles as a cocktail lounge. The long, barge-like platform slowly rises between floors, taking almost ten minutes to do so, allowing people to finish their drinks. The Oasis of the Seas’ sister ship, the Allure of the Seas was also outfitted with a Rising Tide elevator bar, and it may appear on more ships in the future. Soon elevators on the ocean will all be filled with drunk people.

Shanghai Tower Skyscraper
At more than 630 meters high, the Shanghai Tower is considered the tallest building in China and the second tallest on the planet. But that is not the only thing that catches the attention of this skyscraper, because the speed of the elevator that is inside it is also a reason for admiration.

Capable of climbing at a maximum speed of 20.5 meters per second, this elevator allows anyone to climb the 120 floors of the skyscraper in just under 55 seconds. Amazing! And sure, because the elevator has modern braking devices and speed limiters to have everything under control.
